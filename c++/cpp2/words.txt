Dear Colleagues,

Two weeks ago we had to cancel the global Business Update webcasts due to a last minute change in Shaygan's travel plans. Although this was unfortunate it gave us the opportunity to do even better and schedule local town halls. These will not only allow you to discuss your topics with Shaygan face to face but also aligns with Shaygan's preference to talk and interact with people directly. 

It's therefore our pleasure to announce the events as follows:

Monday, September 19,  town hall at the Munich site
Tuesday, September 20, town hall at the Berlin site
Wednesday, September 21, town hall at the Lisbon site
Tuesday, September 27, town hall at the Naperville site
Invitations including the specific details for each of the town halls will be sent out shortly.


In addition, a global webcast at the end of October is planned for colleagues who will not have been able to attend one of the town hall meetings.

We are looking forward to interesting events with a lot of discussions. So please come prepared with your questions.

In case of questions related to the events please send them to global.communications@coriant.com.


Best regards,

Renate
